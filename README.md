# CFPB-Complaints
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is the U.S. government agency that implements and enforces federal consumer finance laws.
The complaint database includes complaints filed since 2011, when the agency was created, about various products such as credit cards, prepaid cards, consumer loans, student loans, debt collection, mortgages, money transfers, and bank accounts, among others.

## The complaint process
- The consumer files a complaint or is referred to the CFPB by another government agency.
- The CFPB sends the complaint to the relevant company for review.
- The company contacts the consumer as needed and typically responds within 15 days. In some cases, the company may set the response as “in process” and provide a final response within 60 days.
- The CFPB publishes the complaint to the database after removing any identifying information.
- The CFPB lets consumers know when a company responds. Consumers can review a company’s response and provide feedback within 60 days.
- Google stores its complaint database on BigQuery and makes it available to the public for easy access and use.
